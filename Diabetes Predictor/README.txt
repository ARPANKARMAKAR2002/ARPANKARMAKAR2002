Problem Statement:
Develop an AI/ML model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related factors. The model should take into account demographic information, medical history, and other relevant features to make accurate predictions. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of diabetes early on, enabling timely interventions and personalized healthcare plans.

Dataset:
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of anonymized patient records, including demographic information (age) and clinical measurements (glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc.). It should be sufficiently large and diverse to capture various patterns and trends related to diabetes onset.
